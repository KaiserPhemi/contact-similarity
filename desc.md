# Problem Definition

Let's say we have a group of 1,000 people - each with 700 to 900 phone contacts each.

## Description

We would like to filter out those with phone number contact similarity above 30%. That is, if there any two people who have more than 30% similarity in their contact lists, we would like to know.

This assignment will require you to:

1. Simulate contacts by writing a script to:

a) Generate phone number contacts for each of the 1,000 people. Remember, contact list size varies from 700 to 900.

b) The generation script should randomly allow for duplication of phone numbers across each person. The rate of duplication can be anything between 10 to 50%.

Thereafter, you are expected to come up with the most efficient/elegant algorithm for filtering out the people with above 30% similarity.
